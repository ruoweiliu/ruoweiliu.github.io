## Research Projects
**GRADUATE RESEARCHER:**
* Conduct research in geospatial analytics, social media data science, sampling bias evaluation, and predictive modeling.
  -	Analyzed spatial, temporal activity patterns, demographic differences and sampling bias between Twitter and X users in the contiguous U.S. (Python, ArcGIS Pro).
  -	Developed a conceptual framework for evaluating and correcting sampling bias in geotagged social media datasets and conducted a literature review about current methods (Oral Presentation at <span class="green-text">AAG 2023</span> and <span class="green-text">AAG 2024</span>).
  -	Integrated Twitter sentiment with election forecasting models and predicted U.S. presidential election outcomes (Python, NLP, ArcGIS, Machine Learning Models; Oral Presentation at <span class="green-text">AAG 2019</span>; <span class="award-text">Annals of GIS Most Downloaded Paper Award 1st Place and Best Paper Award 3rd Place</span>).
  -	Evaluated gender representativeness of Twitter datasets and mapped spatial variation (Python, ArcGIS Pro; <span class="green-text">UCGIS 2020</span> Poster Gallery; Oral Presentation at <span class="green-text">AAG 2021</span>).

**RESEARCH COLLABORATOR:**
* Collaborated on interdisciplinary research projects in transportation, public health, and spatial modeling.
  -	Examined geographic context factors influencing traffic violations using theory-guided and deep learning models (Published in <span class="green-text">CEUS</span>).
  -	Developed a place-time-specific transmissibility index for COVID-19 and assessed spatiotemporal variations in infectiousness (Published in <span class="green-text">Annals of the AAG</span>; <span class="award-text">UGA Geography Globe Award for Methodological Advancement</span>).

**APPLIED RESEARCH PROJECTS:**
* Research Assistant, National Institute of Health (NIH) Project: TB Movement Reconstruction
  -	Conducted spatial and temporal interpolation of call detail records and reconstructed movement patterns of Tuberculosis (TB) cases in Kampala, Uganda (Python).
* NSF I-GUIDE Summer School: Urban Green Spaces Cooling Effects
  -	Employed machine learning models to extract UGS and evaluated cooling effects across the southeastern United States (Python; Oral Presentation at <span class="green-text">NSF I-GUIDE Summer School</span> and Virtual Consulting Office Webinar).
  
**COURSE-BASED RESEARCH PROJECTS:**
  -	Classified influenza-like illness tweets using machine learning models and compared patterns with CDC flu maps.
  -	Analyzed subjective well-being across Athens, Georgia and identified key local factors affecting community health.
  -	Examined personal happiness in mainland China using geographically weighted regression (Poster Presentation at <span class="green-text">AAG 2017</span>).

**UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCH EXPERIENCE:**
* Undergraduate Thesis: Freeboard Retrieval and Analysis Using NASA Digital Mapping System (DMS) and Airborne Topographic Mapper (ATM) Data
  -	Classified DMS imagery, derived sea surface height relationships, and calculated Arctic freeboard (<span class="award-text">Excellent Undergraduate Thesis Award</span>).
* Sea Ice Thickness and Snow Depth Analysis, China National Science Foundation Project
  -	Extracted elevation data and estimated ice thickness and snow depth in the West Antarctic Seas.
