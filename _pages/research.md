## Research Projects

- **Graduate Researcher:** Analyzed spatial, temporal activity patterns, demographic differences and sampling bias between Twitter and X users in the contiguous U.S. (Python, ArcGIS Pro).

- **Graduate Researcher:** Developed a conceptual framework for evaluating and correcting sampling bias in geotagged social media datasets and conducted a literature review (oral presentation at 2023 and 2024 AAG).

- **Graduate Researcher:** Integrated Twitter sentiment with election forecasting models and predicted U.S. presidential election outcomes (published in Annals of GIS).

- **Graduate Researcher:** Evaluated gender representativeness of Twitter datasets and mapped spatial variation (AAG 2021; UCGIS 2020).

- **Research Collaborator:** Examined geographic context factors influencing traffic violations using theory-guided and deep learning models (published in CEUS).

- **Research Collaborator:** Developed a place-time-specific transmissibility index for COVID-19 and assessed spatiotemporal variations in infectiousness (published in Annals of the AAG).

- **Applied Research (NIH):** Conducted spatial and temporal interpolation of call detail records and reconstructed movement patterns of Tuberculosis (TB) cases in Kampala, Uganda.

- **Applied Research (NSF I-GUIDE):** Employed machine learning models to extract Urban Green Spaces (UGS) and evaluated cooling effects across the southeastern United States.
